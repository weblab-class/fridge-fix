# FridgeFix
Inspired from the frustrations of living in an undergraduate cook-for-yourself community, we made this webapp to to help users reduce individual food waste and keep better track of their food. 

## Description
FridgeFix tracks food supply and expiration dates, maintains grocery lists, and recommends simple recipes based on what is currently available and unexpired.
